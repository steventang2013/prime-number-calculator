# Prime Number Calculator Test

## Task
Fork this repo, and finish writing the function `findPrimeNumbers` inside `PrimeNumberCalculator`.

The function will take a from integer and a to integer, and return a sequence of the prime numbers between those two numbers.

## Examples
```scala
PrimeNumberCalculator.findPrimeNumbers(10, 20)
```
would return `Seq(11,13,17,19)`

## Downloads
Download and install sbt

## How to run
- From the command line navigate to the project location
- Compile your function with `sbt compile`
- Test your function with `sbt test`

## Recommendations
I strongly recommend downloading and installing IntelliJ, and adding in the scala plugin as it's incredibly useful.
